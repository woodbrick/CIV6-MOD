[*] Updated mutually exclusive building tooltip to more accurately represent how National Wonders work.
[*] Grand Temple no longer requires you to have founded a religion.

[*] (Rise and Fall) Great Library changed so that it no longer provides +1 Great Writer point, a free Great Writer, or +2 Science from Great Works of Writing. Instead, provides its old bonus of +1 Great Writer point per turn in each city with a Library, and also provides a random Eureka when you earn a Great Writer, in addition to when another player earns a Great Scientist.
[*] (Rise and Fall) Statue of Liberty bonuses changed. No longer provides stable loyalty to nearby cities or free settlers.

Changed Harbor adjacency requirement to City Center.

[*] (Rise and Fall) St. Basil's Cathedral now must be built on Tundra or Tundra Hills tiles adjacent to the City Center. Its Religious Tourism bonus applies to all of your cities, not just the city in which it is built.

[b]Changelog 1.9.4[/b][LIST]
[*] Fixed a localization problem.
[/LIST]

[b]Changelog 1.9.3[/b][LIST]
[*] Re-enabled Chinese translation.
[/LIST]

[b]Changelog 1.9.2[/b][LIST]
[*] Jebel Barkal no longer allows you to purchase units with faith. Instead, it has the following benefit: Gain Faith equal to 25% of the unit's cost when producing a non civilian unit in any city in your empire.
[*] I liked the previous modifier but it was incompatible with the Theocracy government. This one should encourage the same kind of gameplay, however.
[*] Fixed Heroic Epic text: Gain Culture equal to 25% of the unit's cost when producing a non civilian unit in the city.
[/LIST]

[b]Changelog 1.9.1[/b][LIST]
[*] Fixed Terracotta Army and Venetian Arsenal providing three units rather than two when producing certain units. Hopefully, anyway.
[*] Changed the Shrine of the Saint, Mahabodhi Temple, Hagia Sophia, Mont St. Michel, and Potala Palace to affect Holy Site district yields, rather than building yields. They increase the yields of your Holy Sites for each building in those districts.
[*] Instead of providing +1 Faith to Monuments, now Stonehenge provides +1 Faith to your City Center districts that contain a Monument.
[*] The above was done to hopefully resolve issues where building yields did not update properly when capturing cities founded prior to constructing the appropriate wonder. Districts seem to update properly, while buildings do not.
[*] The Indonesian Prasat should be properly recognized as a Temple by the above wonders.
[*] Temporarily disabled foreign translations as they are no longer accurate (if those who did them get in touch with me, we can update them!).[/LIST]

[b]Changelog 1.9.0[/b][LIST]
[*] Updated the Shrine of the Saint and Potala Palace to properly affect the Dar-E-Mehr and Stupa.
[*] Apadana: Removed previous bonuses. Now provides 1 Envoy upon completion, as well as 1 additional Envoy whenever you complete a Wonder in any of your cities. Also provides +3 Influence points per turn towards earning envoys.
[*] Mausoleum at Halicarnassus: +3 Great Admiral points per combat kill using naval units. +1 Great Admiral and +1 Great Engineer points per turn.
[*] Venetian Arsenal: Moved Great Admiral points per kill to Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Instead now gives empire-wide +1 Production to coast tiles.
[*] Angkor Wat gives +3 amenities from Entertainment.
[*] Terracotta Army effects changed to match World Wonders-only version. Now provides one promotion level for all current units upon completion, and whenever you build a military unit in the city, you receive a second copy of that unit.
[*] Oracle's original bonuses restored, except Faith patronage discount still at 50%.
[*] Heroic Epic effects changed. No longer provides experience and combat strength bonus. Instead provides a free promotion for units trained in the city. When you produce a unit in the city, you gain 25% of the unit's combat strength as culture.
[*] National Academy effects changed. No longer provides a free promotion for all current units. Instead provides +100% Experience and +4 Combat Strength for land units trained in the city.
[*] Apostolic Palace can now be built with the Stupa or Dar-E-Mehr as a prerequisite. [/LIST]

Changelog 1.8.6
[*] Added Chinese Translation
[*] Colossus no longer provides a free Trader for constructed harbor districts, nor does it provide extra trade routes for each Harbor. It has been reverted to simply grant a free trader and increased trade route capacity by 1. It still boosts the gold income of trade routes and additionally intercontinential yields as normal.
[*] Alhambra and the Venetian Arsenal now provide 3 Great Person Points per kill instead of 5.

Changelog 1.8.2

[*] Removed ExclusiveBuildings for the National Heritage Site and all National Wonders in the Holy Site district. They can now be built in the same city.
[*] Added a very small amount of Outer Defense Health to National Wonders. This will cause them to be destroyed upon capture.
[*] National Wonder cost rebalanced for later eras.
[*] Slightly reduced the Culture yield of some National Wonders.

Changelog 1.8

[*] Added dependency for Aztec DLC Pack.
[*] Added reference for TCS Omnibus (so it will always load after the Omnibus, fixing some potential compatibility issues).
[*] Huey Teocalli: Local lake-based amenities preserved, but other bonuses changed to +3 Food and +2 Culture for each lake tile in your empire. Campus, Commercial Hubs, Theater Squares, Holy Sites, and Industrial Zone districts in your empire receive increased yields when adjacent to a lake.
