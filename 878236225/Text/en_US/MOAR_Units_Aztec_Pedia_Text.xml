			<Text>In Aztec culture, war was as much a religious rite as it was a political tool. Young stallions had to capture or kill enemies in order to attain high status, and ever-increasing numbers of prisoners were needed as sacrifices for the Aztecs' religious rituals. The Jaguar Warriors were elite professional soldiers in the Aztec army. Clad in jaguar skins and equipped with deadly "macuahuitls" (wooden swords studded with sharp obsidian shards), the Jaguars were perhaps the deadliest light infantry found in Pre-Columbian Central and North America.</Text>

			<Text>The mighty Aztec warrior priests were not only important figures in society but also fearsome warriors who were more than capable of wielding a macuahuitl with deadly intent on the battlefield. In normal life Aztec priests would be responsible for many tasks, and often occupied high positions in society. They would be the life and blood of the Aztec religion, but also worked in government, created calenders, and were the primary record keepers. In addition they would teach in the schools and warrior training structures like the Calmecac and the Telpochocalli. As a warrior priest however their role was different, they would fight alongside the Aztec warriors blow for blow. The warrior priests were armed with weaponry capable of inflicting severe injury, and they were protected with armour and shields and were more than capable or holding their ground.</Text>
