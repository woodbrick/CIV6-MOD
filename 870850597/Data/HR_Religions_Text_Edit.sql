This can be achieved through meditation and insight or through the study of Buddhist canon and scripture. The role of the layman and monk are clearly differentiated by Theravadins, who do not consider it possible to attain enlightenment while one is living the life of a layman. However, laypeople actively participate in the religion by providing material support to the monks (which produces positive karma), meditating, and following the basic ethical principles of the Buddha''s teachings.');
